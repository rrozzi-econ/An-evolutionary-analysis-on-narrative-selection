# An-evolutionary-analysis-on-narrative-selection
This repository includes the codes of the simulations from the paper "An evolutionary analysis on narrative selection" written by Roberto Rozzi and Federico Innocenti

The code part must be insert in the dedicated part of NetLogo, while the in the interface part I insert the commands to setup the interface functional to the code. Other plots and monitors are optional.

The project explores how different belief-updating strategies influence the long-term composition of a population when agents strategically choose which narrative to use. All agents follow Bayes' Rule, but their choice of narrative is governed by different selection criteria. By simulating various scenarios with different levels of uncertainty regarding the state of the world, we examine which strategies prevail over time. Our findings highlight the evolutionary advantage of conformist agentsâ€”those who align their narratives with the average population belief. The survival of other agent types depends on uncertainty: skeptical agents, who adopt mild beliefs, perform better in high-uncertainty environments, while those prone to extreme beliefs thrive in low-uncertainty settings.

The repository contains four netlogo code sections for the four different laws of motion and a netlogo interface which is standard for all laws of motion.
